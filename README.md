<h1>Music-Player :octocat:</h1>
<h2>* Frontend - </h2>
A music player using SoundCloud API.
Technologies used are HTML, CSS and Javascipt. Data format for handling data during request - json (for obvious reasons).
You can ofcourse fork this project and add more animations such as scss and make it beautiful.:shipit:

<h2>* PWA (Progessive Web App) - </h2>
I have also added PWA feauture to this project. I thought of doing so as I consider PWA to be prominent technology emerging in the field of mobile app. This statement is with respect to 2020 ;)
